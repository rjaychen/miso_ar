# Misophonia AR
Misophonia is a condition affecting some people wherein they experience negative reactions to certain audio sounds (triggers).

This repo is based off the MRTKDevTemplate project from Unity. Larger files, such as spatial audio, have been omitted from the project due to sizing restrictions, but are available through the Mixed Reality Feature Tool found here. 

The bulk of my work involves adding a new scenes found in miso_ar/UnityProjects/MRTKDevTemplate that provide experiences for people afflicted with misophonia. You can read more about misophonia ![here](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia#:~:text=Misophonia%20is%20a%20disorder%20in,and%20the%20need%20to%20flee.)

This project is a collaboration between the I^3T lab at Duke and the ![Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation](https://psychiatry.duke.edu/duke-center-misophonia-and-emotion-regulation)

**MRTK3** is the third generation of the Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity. It's an open source project designed to accelerate cross-platform mixed reality development in Unity. MRTK3 is built on top of [Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit (XRI)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.1/manual/index.html) and OpenXR. This new generation of MRTK is intended to be faster, cleaner, and more modular, with an easier cross-platform development workflow enabled by OpenXR and the Unity Input System.

## Requirements

MRTK3 requires Unity 2021.3.21 or higher. In addition, you need the [Mixed Reality Feature Tool for Unity](https://aka.ms/mrfeaturetool) to find, download, and add the packages to your project.
